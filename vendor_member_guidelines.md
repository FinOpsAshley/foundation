# Vendor Member Guidelines

All participants must follow the Linux Foundation code of conduct and the FinOps Foundation member expectations, vendors should see especially the "No Sales Pitches" section: https://github.com/finopsfoundation/foundation/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md

## Slack Access Criteria

We will grant slack access to participants from your company who fit the [FinOps practitioner definition](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/foundation/blob/master/practitioner_definition.md). Those outside of that will be considered on a one-off basis by the membership committee, however the stance on no sales people (or those who hold quotas of any kind, such as technical pre-sales) is firm. The ideal participants are SMEs who know both cloud financial management and your product from hands-on work. SMEs from FinOps, cloud, or cloud management vendors who are FinOps Foundation vendor members in good standing (either General or Premier) may join the slack.

## Adding People to Slack

All Slack participants must request access via the membership form at https://FinOps.org/membership and be approved before gaining access. They should request access as a “General Vendor Member” or “Premier Vendor Member” depending on their level and provide all of their details for review. Once approved, they will receive a link to join Slack.

## Slack Room Participation

Following the [code of conduct](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/foundation/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md), participation should be focused on sharing thought leadership (not sales pitches) and further the field of vendor-neutral cloud financial management. 

In general rooms, a good example of an interaction might look like:

> “Have you considered using a concatenated tag strategy to solve the problem you’re facing? I’ve seen one work like this: XYZ”

A bad one would be:

> “We can fix that problem for you with our amazing concatenated tag feature, start a free trial of it here.”

## FinOps Certified Platform dedicated Slack rooms (e.g., #opsani, #cloudability, #cloudhealth, #prosperops, etc)

In your own room (#finops-on-vendor) you have more flexibility in directly discussing the ways you fix the problems with your features, as many will be there to see that. The code of conduct still stands and we encourage you to promote and engage in thoughtful conversations in your room with your customers (and potential ones) that are a mix of thought leadership and helpful information about your specific product.
