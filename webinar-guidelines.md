# F2 Webinar Guidelines #

## Overview ##

F2 webinars are offered to the community to educate about cloud financial management best practices and technologies. Webinars are offered by vendor members, F2 Ambassadors, and F2 SIGs.

Please note: We are unable to share leads due to the Linux Foundation privacy policy.

## Webinar day and time ##

English language webinars are scheduled for Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

Project, Ambassador, and SIG webinars are scheduled for Fridays. 

Chinese language webinars are scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday Beijing time.

## Please read the guidelines carefully ##
We have outlined content guidelines and timelines. Webinars that do not meet the requirements will be cancelled. 

You must provide your webinar details no later than 4 weeks before the webinar date. At least 2 weeks prior to the webinar date you must provide your complete and final slides.

If the webinar is cancelled due to not meeting these guidelines, the member will not be allowed to schedule a webinar in the subsequent webinar period. That is, platinum and gold members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming quarter and silver members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming 6 months.

## Who can host a webinar ##

Member webinars

* Platinum and Gold Members can host 1 webinar per quarter, based on availability.
* Silver members can host 1 webinar every 6 months, based on availability.
* End user supporter members cannot hold a webinar.
* F2 Member webinars will have "Member webinar" preceding their webinar title.
 
Project webinars

* Graduated and incubating projects can hold a webinar twice a year. These webinars can communicate release launch details or provide a project update. The exception is Kubernetes who holds a webinar each quarter approximately 30 days after the release.

## Webinar type definitions ##
 
Project webinar: A webinar on a graduated or incubating project. This is presented by or on behalf of the project. If presented by a member about a project, this webinar is classified as a Project webinar. An example is a Harbor webinar presented by the VMware team. The webinar is classified as a Project webinar.

Member webinar: A webinar presented by a member. The webinar must comply with the webinar guidelines.

Special Interest Group (SIG) webinar: A webinar presented by a SIG team member(s) is classified as a SIG webinar. If a F2 member presents a webinar on behalf of the SIG, it is classified as a SIG webinar. If a member presents a webinar about a SIG, it is classified as a Member webinar.

Ambassador webinar: This is a webinar presented by one of the F2 Ambassadors.

## Webinar content guidelines ##

* Webinar topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk. 
* Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source.
* Not allowed: 
  * Sales or marketing pitches 
  * Webinars should not be promotional.
  * Avoid demos, screenshots should be used sparingly and primarily to illustrate a best practice visually
* Allowed:
  * Share knowledge, not advertisements
  * Stories are encouraged with real world examples, battles seen in the field
  * Cultural change and examples, why are we in the state that requires this practice, potential deficiencies with current models,  etc.
  * Leave participants with a list of helpful takeaways, not a free trial pitches

Members can add a slide at the end of their webinar on where to get more information.
Examples:

F2 will review the statement, as we do for the content for the webinar, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes. 

## Webinar Calendar ##

The [webinar calendar](https://calendly.com/F2_webinars/F2-webinar) is available for a 6-month period, for example 1H 2020 and 2H 2020. Approximately 6 weeks before the beginning of the time period, the webinar calendar is opened up for scheduling.

To choose a webinar date, go to the webinar calendar to view the available dates. Choose your preferred date. You will receive a calendar invite automatically via Calendly. The calendar invite will be updated with the company / project name, which confirms your webinar. When it gets closer to the webinar date, an email is sent confirming the webinar date is still good for you and outlines the next steps.

## Webinar Checklist ##

4 weeks before the webinar date: [Provide your webinar information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLJ2PSgcE4izH6gCGf7z9-NVcAwqpGt4iwW1nSfL6JF-Wpww/viewform?usp=sf_link) including the webinar abstract and speaker information via the Google Form

2 weeks before the webinar date: [Share your final webinar slides](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdRKv5ZBGZY_tCNWeIiOZA9tTZH3krH7KSThg9W8RFItxxaw/viewform?usp=sf_link) via the Google Form

Please be aware of these new timelines. We recommend you create a reminder to provide us this information by the due date. If we do not receive the information from you within the timelines outlined, your webinar will be cancelled.

If you cannot provide your content via a Google Form (for example, our colleagues in China), please email your webinar materials to webinars@F2.io.

* Webinar title and abstract
* Speaker Information
  * Headshot 
  * Title
  * Company
  * Bio
* Email addresses for all speakers / panelists

All deliverables should be sent to [Webinar](mailto:webinars@F2.io). 

## Webinar Promotion & Prep Details ##

* Upon receipt of the abstract and the webinar being set up in Zoom, the hosting company will receive a link to the webinar registration page. The hosting company should use that link to promote the webinar.
* The webinar is added to the F2 webinar page.
* F2 may promote the webinar via email, F2 and KubeWeekly newsletters, and Twitter.
* Our most successful webinars are when the presenting company helps promote in addition to F2 promotion. We are often able to double our attendance in these cases. 

## Webinar: Presentations ##
* 2 weeks prior to your webinar, send your final webinar presentation to [Webinar](mailto:webinars@F2.io). All presentations must be reviewed prior to the webinar.
* NOTE: presentations not received 2 weeks before the webinar date will result in the webinar being cancelled.

Helpful Notes on Presentation Design

* Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of over 1000 cloud native projects, products, and companies are available in the cloud financial management [landscape].  Note that all of these logos are stacked, not horizontal, and include the name. The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they’re not). In particular, Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have all changed their logos in the last couple years; please use their current one.
* Please see the [F2 style guide].

## Webinar Moderator ##

F2 will provide a moderator for the webinar. The moderator is typically a F2 ambassador or a F2 staff member.

The moderator is responsible for covering the housekeeping items and helping the presenter manage the Q&A.


## Webinar: Day-Of Details ##

* Webinar Prep: ½ hour before the webinar starts. Soundcheck, webinar slides, moderation of the Q&A.
* Live Webinar: Starts at the top of the hour
* Typical timing of the webinar - approximately 5 minute introduction, 45 minute presentation, 10 minutes of Q&A
* A F2 Ambassador or F2 staff will help moderate (introduction, feeding questions to the presenter) 
* Webinar Platform: Zoom 

After the webinar, registration numbers and a link to the webinar on YouTube will be shared with the company hosting the webinar. F2 does not provide a copy of the webinar recording for individual company use.

Please note: We are unable to share the list of leads or include any promotions with the intention of driving leads.
